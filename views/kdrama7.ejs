            Move to Heaven is inspired by the essay "Things Left Behind" by Kim Sae-byul, a former "trauma cleaner". Geu-ru (Tang
            Jun-sang), who has Asperger syndrome, and his ex-convict uncle Sang-gu (Lee Je-hoon) meet for the first time after the
            sudden death of Geu-ru's father. Entrusted as Geu-ru's guardian, Sang-gu joins his nephew to help run the family trauma
            cleaning company "Move to Heaven", where in the course of business they uncover untold stories about the deceased while
            Sang-gu tries to deal with his painful past with Geu-ru's father as well as the traumatic incident that landed him in
            jail.
