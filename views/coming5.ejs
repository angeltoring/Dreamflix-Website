            In a truly sad and shocking turn of events, we lost Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman to colon cancer in 2020, and
            both filmmakers and fans across the world mourned his passing. This obviously led to questions about what would happen
            to the Marvel character, as he was set to become an important piece of the MCU's future. As it turns out, we're still
            getting a second film in 2022, but Boseman will not be recast, and the story will instead shift to focus on King
            T'Challa's spunky sister Shuri, played by Letitia Wright. Outside of that, we don't know what the film will entail,
            including how T'Challa's absence will be addressed.
